    <p>
      The Rubik’s Cube has been one of the most popular toys in the entire world since its release.
      However, over the years not many people have learnt to solve one. Despite this, there are many 
      algorithms that allow both humans and computers to solve the cube and, after many years of
      evolution and optimisation, this has culminated in astonishingly fast times. This method of 
      solving the cube has proven success, for example, the current world record for the 3x3x3 is held
      by Max Park (USA) and he was able to solve the cube in 3.13 seconds (<a href="#WCAa" class="in-text-citation">
      World Cube Association, 2024a</a>) and the fastest average of 5 solves, held by Yiheng Wang (China),
      is 4.09 seconds (<a href="#WCAb" class="in-text-citation">Word Cube Association, 2024b</a>). The algorithms
      themselves have led to different methods of solving the cube such as CFOP, ZZ, and ROUX which all 
      have their own benefits and trade-offs.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      This article is an exploration of the algorithms that can be applied to solving the Rubik’s Cube.
      Firstly, there will be an explanation of the notation that is used to describe the turns that can 
      be done on the cube and how they relate to algorithms. Secondly, there will be a description of 
      the most common method for solving the cube (CFOP) and the algorithms that are used in this method
      (<a href="#J Perm, 2017" class="in-text-citation">J Perm, 2017</a>). In addition to this, a basic
      introduction to the ZZ and ROUX methods and comparison to CFOP will be given
      (<a href="#J Perm, 2019" class="in-text-citation">J Perm, 2019</a>). Furthermore, there will be an
      exploration of the algorithms that are used to get a computer to solve a Rubik’s Cube and some of
      the different mathematical concepts and fields that they link to. Finally, this article will also
      explain the evolution and optimisation of the algorithms and methods over time and how this has
      affected the speed at which people and computers have been able to solve the Rubik’s Cube.
    </p>
  
    <h3 id="Cube Notation">Cube Notation</h3>
    <p>
      In order to solve the Rubik's Cube using the aforementioned methods and algorithms, it is necessary to 
      understand both the possible turns that can be done and the notation that is used to denote them. Each
      turn, this includes both a turn of a layer and a rotation of the whole cube, is given a letter to
      represent it. This can be most easily understood by seeing it in a graphical representation (see Figure 1).
    </p>
    <div class="figure-container">
      <img src="images/figure1.png" alt="Figure 1" class="figure">
      <span class="figure-citation">Figure 1: Rubik’s Cube Notation (<a href="#Struyf, 2024a" class="in-text-citation">Struyf, 2024a</a>)</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      The first row shows the different turns that can be done to each layer of the cube. Furthermore, the second
      row highlights the fact that each of these turns can be done in the opposite direction (denoted by an apostrophe),
      that a number after the letter denotes how many times the turn should be done, and that a lowercase letter indicates
      turning two layers at once. Finally, the third row shows the different turns that can be done to the full cube (e.g. rotations).
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="CFOP">CFOP</h3>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier, CFOP (<strong>C</strong>ross <strong>F</strong>2L <strong>O</strong>rientation of the last layer
      <strong>P</strong>ermutation of the last layer) is one of the most popular methods for solving the Rubik’s Cube
      (<a href="#J Perm, 2017" class="in-text-citation">J Perm, 2017</a>). This is mainly due to the benefits that it has over other
      methods (see “Method Comparisons” for more details). The CFOP method consists of four steps and all but the first include the
      usage of algorithms. The first step is to make a cross, the second is to fill in the remaining corner-edge pairs, and the final
      two steps are the orientation and permutation of the last two layers. The final three steps are usually abbreviated to F2L, OLL,
      and PLL respectively (<a href="#Struyf, 2024b" class="in-text-citation">Struyf, 2024b</a>). As with the cube notation, it is much easier
      to visualise these steps than it is to describe them (see Figure 2). Note that in CFOP steps 2 and 3 are combined into 1 step (F2L).
    </p>
    <div class="figure-container">
      <img src="images/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2" class="figure">
      <span class="figure-citation">Figure 2: CFOP Method Steps (<a href="#J Perm, 2024" class="in-text-citation">J Perm, 2024</a>)</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      As you can gather from Figure 2, the CFOP method is relatively intuitive and simple for the average person to understand 
      and learn and therefore it has been widely used across the speedcubing community. It combines an intuitive start with the 
      cross, an intuitive continuation by solving the corner-edge pairs, and two algorithmic steps to finish the cube thus creating 
      something quite simple for humans to learn. However, despite its popularity, CFOP is not necessarily the best method for 
      solving the Rubik’s Cube, but it is one of the most understandable for humans (<a href="#J Perm, 2017" class="in-text-citation">J Perm, 2017</a>).
      See the “Method Comparisons” and “Computer-based methods” sections for more detail on this.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Method Comparisons">Method Comparisons</h3>
    <p>
      As discussed before, there are three main methods that people use to solve the Rubik’s Cube and those are the following: CFOP, 
      ROUX, and ZZ. In a video discussing this topic (<a href="#J Perm, 2019" class="in-text-citation">J Perm, 2019</a>), the author compares some important properties about each method.
      Firstly, the properties compared are the average move count, move types, cube rotations, look ahead (the ability to anticipate 
      the next moves/algorithms), and regrips. Figure 3 is my summary of the conclusions drawn in the video
      (<a href="#J Perm, 2019" class="in-text-citation">J Perm, 2019</a>).
    </p>
    <div class="figure-container">
      <img src="images/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3" class="figure">
      <span class="figure-citation">Figure 3: Rubik’s Cube Method Comparisons</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      Conclusions about which method is best could be drawn from these results, however, from personal experience, it is also very
      important to consider the difficulty to learn each method. Again, from personal experience, this, in combination from the higher 
      number of available resources for learning CFOP, may be the reason why CFOP is much more widely used despite methods like Roux 
      seeming more efficient.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Computer-based Methods">Computer-based Methods</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the many methods above, there are also computational methods that can solve a Rubik’s cube. An example of this,
      is machine learning techniques. Some researchers were able to use reinforcement learning to achieve this (<a href="#Agostinelli et al., 2019" class="in-text-citation">Agostinelli et al., 2019</a>).
      Furthermore, the mathematical problem of a Rubik’s Cube relates to many fields such as cryptography and
      group theory (<a href="#Polylog, 2022" class="in-text-citation">Polylog, 2022</a>). For example, the sheer number of states that the
      Rubik’s Cube can take makes it a very interesting combinatorial problem.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Evolution & Optimisation">Evolution & Optimisation</h3>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, there are some extremely impressive times that people are now getting on the Rubik’s Cube. For this to happen,
      there has been a lot of optimisations over the years. Hardware improvements (such as magnets) have had a considerable impact. However,
      this has been largely due to new algorithms and innovations for the methods that exist. For example, there is a new method that skips
      OLL and goes straight to PLL from F2L and this is called ZBLL (<a href="#Chubb, 2024" class="in-text-citation">Chubb, 2024</a>). With this
      method the future of faster and faster times, which may even result in more 3 second solves, seems to be becoming a reality.
