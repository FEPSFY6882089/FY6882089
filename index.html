    <pre>The Rubikâ€™s Cube has been one of the most popular toys in the entire world since its release.
    However, over the years not many people have learnt to solve one. Despite this, there are many 
    algorithms that allow both humans and computers to solve the cube and, after many years of
    evolution and optimisation, this has culminated in astonishingly fast times. This method of 
    solving the cube has proven success, for example, the current world record for the 3x3x3 is held
    by Max Park (USA) and he was able to solve the cube in 3.13 seconds (World Cube Association, 2024)
    and the fastest average of 5 solves, held by Yiheng Wang (China), is 4.09 seconds (Word Cube
    Association, 2024). The algorithms themselves have led to different methods of solving the cube 
    such as CFOP, ZZ, and ROUX which all have their own benefits and trade-offs.</pre>
